        <p>“When I look back, I am so impressed again with the life-giving power of literature. </p>
        <p> If I were a young person today, trying to gain a sense of myself in the world, I would do that again by reading, just as I did when I was young.” </p>
        <p>– Maya Angelou</p>

        <h2>What is BookClub?</h2>
        <p>It's the Indian Library. It's a smart social networking site. It's a celebration of literature and a place where books get new life.</p>
        <p>BookCrossing is the act of giving a book a unique identity so, as the book is passed from reader to reader, it can be tracked </p>
        <p>and thus connecting its readers. You can rent books here as well you can buy new books. </p>
        <br><h2>What's our mission?</h2>
        <p>Very simply, we aim to connect people through books. </p>
